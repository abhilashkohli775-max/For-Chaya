      I’ve thought a lot before writing this.<br>
      Not to convince you.<br>
      Not to force anything.<br><br>
      Just because keeping everything inside felt heavier than saying it once with honesty.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      I know the last one and a half months were difficult.<br>
      For you, and for me.<br><br>

      I was overwhelmed, anxious, and emotionally unstable at times.<br>
      Instead of understanding you, I reacted from fear.<br>
      I know that must have hurt you — and I take responsibility for that.<br><br>

      I’m not proud of that version of me.

      <strong>Let’s start all over again.<br>
      I am not the person I was in the past one and a half months.</strong><br><br>

      I’ve slowed down.<br>
      I’ve reflected.<br>
      I’ve understood where I went wrong and why.<br><br>

      I’m calmer now.<br>
      More aware.<br>
      More capable of listening instead of reacting.

    <p>
      What I felt for you was real.<br>
      It wasn’t habit.<br>
      It wasn’t convenience.<br>
      It was genuine care.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <img src="photo4.jpg" class="photo">
    <p>
      You mattered to me then.<br>
      You matter to me now.

      This page is not a request or a demand.<br>
      It’s not meant to pressure you into anything.<br><br>

      I just wanted to leave behind honesty instead of silence.<br><br>

      If there is ever space to talk calmly, I’m here.<br>
      And if your decision is already made, I will respect it completely.
    </p>

  <div class="final">
    This is my truth.<br>
    The rest is not in my control.<br><br>
    — From someone who cared deeply
